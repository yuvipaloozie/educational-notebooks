## MNIST with ML
The MNIST dataset is typically used as an introductory application of convolutional neural networks (CNN) due to the unstructured nature of the data and the power of deep learning models given advances in hardware. While extremely accurate and powerful, NNs are "black box" models that typically suffer from clear mechanisitic interpretability of their learning process. This project demonstrates how using more "traditional" ML approaches, coupled with intentional feature engineering, can still perform as well as CNN counterparts.
