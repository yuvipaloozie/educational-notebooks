## Summary
This project challenges the industry trend of relying solely on Deep Learning for biological signal processing. It benchmarks a 1D-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) against a lightweight Logistic Regression classifier that utilizes domain-specific feature engineering (Non-Linear Dynamics and Chaos Theory).

**Hypothesis:** A model grounded in physiological principles can achieve comparable diagnostic performance to a "black box" neural network while offering superior interpretability and magntitudes of reduction in training time. 

## Background and Motivation

### 1. The Biological Context: How the Heart "Speaks"
The heart is not just a muscle; it is an electromechanical pump controlled by a complex biological circuit.
* **The Signal:** Every heartbeat is triggered by an electrical impulse from the Sinoatrial (SA) Node. This impulse travels down conductive pathways (His-Purkinje system), causing the muscle fibers to contract.
* **The ECG:** An Electrocardiogram (ECG) measures the voltage changes on the skin caused by this electrical wave. A normal heartbeat produces a specific shape called the **P-QRS-T complex**:
    * **P-wave:** Atrial contraction.
    * **QRS Complex:** Ventricular contraction (the main "spike").
    * **T-wave:** Resetting (repolarization).

### 2. The Clinical Problem: Defining Arrhythmia
An arrhythmia is any deviation from the normal rate or rhythm of the heart. Clinicians generally look for two distinct types of failures:
1.  **Failures of Rhythm (Timing):** The electrical "pacemaker" is misfiring. The heart beats too fast, too slow, or irregularly (e.g., Atrial Fibrillation).
    * *Doctor's Check:* Is the spacing between beats (R-R Interval) constant?
2.  **Failures of Conduction (Morphology):** The electrical signal is blocked or delayed in the tissue. The heart beats on time, but the wave has to take a detour, changing its shape (e.g., Left Bundle Branch Block).
    * *Doctor's Check:* Is the QRS complex narrow (sharp) or wide (blunted)?

### 3. The Mathematical Translation: From Biology to Physics
This project hypothesizes that we do not need a neural network to learn these patterns from scratch. We can explicitly engineer features that map directly to the clinician's checklist:

| Clinical Feature | Mathematical Domain | The Feature We Engineered |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rhythm Stability** | **Non-Linear Dynamics (Chaos Theory)** | **Poincaré Plots:** We map each beat interval ($t_n$) against the next ($t_{n+1}$). A stable heart creates a tight cluster; a chaotic heart (AFib) creates a scattered cloud. We quantify this with **Entropy** and **SD1/SD2** geometry. |
| **Signal Shape** | **Statistical Moments** | **Kurtosis (Peakedness):** A healthy beat is a sharp spike (High Kurtosis). A blocked beat (LBBB) is a wide, sluggish wave (Low Kurtosis). This single metric mathematically describes the "Morphology." |
| **Signal Direction** | **Distribution Asymmetry** | **Skewness:** A Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC) originates from the bottom of the heart, reversing the signal polarity. This flips the statistical skew of the wave. |

**Why this matters:** By translating "Medical Symptoms" into "Physics Metrics," we create a model that is inherently interpretable. If the model predicts *Arrhythmia*, we can explain exactly why: *"The signal entropy was high (Chaos) and the Kurtosis was low (Blockage)."*




## Data Source and Processing
* **Source:** [MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database](https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/) (PhysioNet).
* **Specifications:** 48 half-hour excerpts of 2-channel ECG recordings at 360 samples per second.
    * Beats in each plot are annotated using a letter code (e.g. 'N' - normal, 'V' - Premature ventricular contraction, 'A' - Atrial premature beat, etc.)
    * Further info for each of the records (patient profile, medication, etc.) can be found at link
* **Preprocessing Pipeline:**
    * **Noise Removal:** 5-15Hz Bandpass filter implementation to remove noisy signals. 
    * **Peak Detection:** Robust algorithm created from scratch to adjust for baseline wander. 
    * **Windowing:** Signals sliced into 10-second non-overlapping windows.
    * **Labeling Strategy:** Windows are classified based on the most severe beat present (Hierarchy: Ventricular > Atrial > Conduction Block > Normal).

## Major Libraries
* **Signal Processing:** `wfdb`, `scipy` 
* **Machine Learning:** `scikit-learn` 
* **Deep Learning:** `tensorflow` / `keras`
* **Data Manipulation:** `numpy`, `pandas`
* **Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## Code Structure
The project is contained within a single reproducible notebook (`arrythmiaml.ipynb`) designed to narrate the comparison and run end-to-end. 
**Note:** The comparison between models was repeated for two different tasks - binary classification (normal vs _any_ arrythmia) and multi-category classification (normal vs LBBB vs RBBB etc.)

1.  **Config Class:** Centralized configuration for sample rates, window sizes, and paths.
2.  **download_full_dataset():** Automates data ingestion directly from PhysioNet.
3.  **HeartEngineer Class:**
    * `pan_tompkins_detector`: Robust R-peak detection.
    * `extract_features`: Generates 11 domain features including SD1/SD2 (Chaos), Kurtosis/Skewness (Morphology), and Sample Entropy.
4.  **Model Definitions:**
    * **Engineering Pipeline:** StandardScaler -> Logistic Regression.
    * **Deep Learning Pipeline:** 2-layer 1D-CNN with Batch Normalization and Dropout.
5.  **Visualization Functions:**
    * `plot_chaos_gallery`: Visualizes Poincaré plots for different arrhythmia classes.
    * `visualize_interpretability`: Compares CNN Saliency Maps vs. Engineering Feature Space.

## Results and Evaluations
The study resulted in a comparison between the two approaches across 5 classes (Normal, LBBB, RBBB, PVC, APC).

| Metric | Engineering Model (Logistic Reg) | Deep Learning (1D-CNN) | Winner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Training Time** | **~0.02 Seconds** | ~30.0 Seconds | **Engineering (1500x Faster)** |
| **Interpretability** | **Transparent (Physics-based)** | Opaque (Saliency Maps) | **Engineering** |
| **RBBB Recall** | **0.90** | 0.82 | **Engineering** |
| **PVC Recall** | 0.49 | **0.54** | Deep Learning |
| **Overall Accuracy** | ~83% | ~86% | Deep Learning (Marginal) |

**Key Findings:**
* **Morphology Matters:** Initially, the Engineering model failed on Bundle Branch Blocks (LBBB). Adding statistical moments (Kurtosis) fixed this, as LBBB beats are statistically "flatter" than normal beats.
* **Efficiency:** The Engineering model is lightweight enough to run on ultra-low-power edge devices (e.g., smartwatches) without GPU acceleration.

## Future Work
* **Edge Deployment:** Port the HeartEngineer logic to C++ for embedded microcontroller testing.
* **Cross-Dataset Validation:** Test robustness on the AHA or PTB Diagnostic ECG Database.
* **Hybrid Architecture:** Implement a stack where the Engineering model handles initial screening (for speed) and the CNN handles ambiguous cases (for precision).
